## Eflows Clustering - 2019-02-20
Did an analysis of local huc assemblages versus cluster assemblages to understand
which hucs and clusters vary significantly based on our current clustering. This can help
inform how useful a cluster may be for managers (since it captures a large or small amount
of the variability within the cluster). Southern California and the northern Sierra did poorly, but smaller clusters in
the Klamath and Great Basin did well (at least in matching cluster assemblages to local assemblages). It's possible this
metric is just flawed, but it can help us understand how much additional variation is external to each HUC for management.
For clusters where, across the cluster, there is a low proportion of species in each huc that are in the cluster assemblage,
managers may have different ideas. But we might also want to try a different clustering method in these areas - it's possible
that this structure is inherent though and changing the method may not matter.

I was curious if we could get a more uniform distribution of (number of species in HUC)/(number of species in cluster) by
doing one clustering run across the state (removing our regionalization/forced barriers). Given the way
the clustering algorithm tries to maximize cluster uniformity and differences between clusters, it seemed like it
should do a bit better. I ran a clustering run, and it did change the results, but it made almost everything south of San
Francisco into a single cluster, which would exacerbate the problem we were experiencing. This is similar to what we previously
saw with statewide clustering.
