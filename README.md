# Research Log

This repository is meant to just catalog the mundane parts of day to day research,
with the goal of providing a record for others of nonobvious, but otherwise unpublishable
results (eg: I tried X, but it didn't work). These are mostly in the form of markdown files
organized by date and topic - designed to be searchable so that with keywords
in a search engine, these things will come up.

The files will have a mix of notes for me about where I'm at in a project, solutions to odd
technological issues, and bits of code as suggestions.
