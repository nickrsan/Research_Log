# Research Log

This repository is meant to just catalog the mundane parts of day to day research,
with the goal of providing a record for others of nonobvious, but otherwise unpublishable
results (eg: I tried X, but it didn't work). Mostly these will be in the form of
Jupyter notebooks, but maybe also markdown files - designed to be searchable so that with keywords
in a search engine, these things will come up.
